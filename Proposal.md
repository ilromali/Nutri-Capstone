### **Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)**

The application I will be building will solve the common issue of customers heading to the supplement store or a supplement department of a grocery store with many questions about dosing, contraindications, or anything of that nature, that may not be answered by employees working in that department. Personally, I have experience working in the supplements department of Natural Grocers where I was the only experienced employee there with enough knowledge to answer customer questions, but if I was not around, there wouldn't be anyone to help them. They may end up buying the wrong product for them that may do more harm than good. The service my application will offer is the ability to look up appropriate supplements based on their malady, along with dosing information, contraindications with other supplements or medications, and links to research resources.

### **List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**

List malodies that users can click on to view appropriate/related supplements. A user can click on "Diabetes" or "Weight Management" to load a list of supplements onto the screen. 

### **What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

Backend: API to store supplement information, built with C#, and using MySQL for the database. The API will store enough information to show proof of concept for the app. 
Frontend: JavaScript using React/Redux to handle UI.

### **If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**

If I finish the MVP, I would like to incorporate a user login feature and allow users to save supplements to their account. 

### **What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**

Implementing a user login feature will require Firestore to hold both account information and saved supplements. 

### **Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?**

I'm a little nervous about hooking up a JS/React/Redux frontend with a C# API, but I'm sure I can figure it out!
