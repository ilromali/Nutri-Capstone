### **Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)**

The application I will be building will solve the common issue of customers heading to the supplement store or a supplement department of a grocery store with many questions about dosing, contraindications, or anything of that nature, that may not be answered by employees working in that department. Personally, I have experience working in the supplements department of Natural Grocers where I was the only experienced employee there with enough knowledge to answer customer questions, but if I was not around, there wouldn't be anyone to help them. They may end up buying the wrong product for them that may do more harm than good. The service my application will offer is the ability to look up appropriate supplements based on their malady, along with dosing information, contraindications with other supplements or medications, and links to research resources.
